'''
Basic: Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. 
Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.

'''
class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

my_car = Car('Audi', 'Red')
print('Car Details:')
print(f'Brand:{my_car.brand}')
print(f'Color:{my_car.color}')


'''
Intermediate: Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message saying the 
engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.

'''


class Car:
    def __init__(self, brand, color):
        self.brand = brand
        self.color = color

    def start_engine(self):
        print(f'The {self.color} {self.brand} engine has started.')

car1 = Car('Mazda', 'White')
print(f' My {car1.brand} car is {car1.color}')

car2 = Car('Audi', 'Maroon')
car2.start_engine()


'''
Advanced: Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:
Deposit an amount.
Withdraw an amount (only if sufficient balance exists).
Print the account balance.
'''

class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, account_number, balance):
        self.account_balance = account_number
        self.balance = balance

    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance +=amount
        print(f'You have deposited {amount} shillings.')
    
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        if self.balance >= 5000:
            self.balance -= amount
        else:
            print('Insufficient Balance.')

    def check_balance(self):
        print(f'Your account balance is {self.balance}')

account1 =BankAccount(1234, 10000)

account1.deposit(2000)
account1.withdraw(1000)
account1.check_balance()



''' Challenge:
Implement a class called Library that manages a collection of books. 
Each book has a title, author, and available status. The Library class should have methods to:

Add a book to the library.
Remove a book from the library.
Check if a book is available by title.
Borrow a book (mark it as unavailable if itâ€™s available).
Return a book (mark it as available again if it was borrowed)'''
